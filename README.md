# Weather-App-Project
A web app that shows the weather based on user's current location. Built using vanilla JavaScript with the help of ChatGPT. 

## Steps
- In order to use this app, you will have to obtain your own API key by registrating on <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a>. 
- The API key will be available for use within a few hours after registration. 
- Delete the import { API_KEY } statement in the weather.js file.
- Replace the ${API_KEY} inside the API reference link in the weather.js file with your own API key. For example:
    - const api = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=${lat}&lon=${long}&appid=1c456f1234b547c9999a294452546d10&units=metric`;
