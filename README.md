# Weather-App-Project
A web app that shows the weather based on user's current location. 

Built using vanilla JavaScript & weather API from Open-Meteo. This app is created based on a tutorial in the YouTube video by developedbyed (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPElVpR1rwA">Build A Weather App With Vanilla Javascript Tutorial</a>). The interactive map is integrated by using the Leaflet library.
